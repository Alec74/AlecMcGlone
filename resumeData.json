    "bio": "I am a science fiction enjoyer, with a love for running, an interest in a technological singularity, and a devotion to learn the many intricacies of coding. Born in a small town in Southwestern CT, I made my move for the love of beaches and ability to leave the cold behind. I like to build things, preferably without breaking them, until they can be in their best form. Outside of projects I picked up the textbooks K.N. King's \"C Programming | A Modern Approach\" and \"Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective\" in the hopes of one day building a new operating system. In my freetime I enjoy reading, playing minecraft, and listening to Lex Fridman's Various conversations about the future of our species.",
